### Assignment Instructions:

1. **Break Down the UI into Components**  
   Take a look at the provided UI. Your task is to divide it into multiple React components. You don't need to write any code for this step. Simply use a pen and paper or a photo editing tool to visualize how the UI can be split into different components. This exercise will help you get a better understanding of component structure in React.
